        <p>Kirby has been an inspirational part of my childhood, growing as a boy. The platforming and character design grabbed my attention and I never let go. This website is just the beginning of what is to come in the near future. The majority of functions wwork so the rest is design and more polish. </p>
        
         <p>The following website is an academic project. Kirby is owned by Nintendo and HAL Laboratory and is the creation of Masahiro Sakurai. Please support the official release of Kirby video games and products.</p>
